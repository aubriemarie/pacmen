## PAC MEN PROJECT
# pacmen

This is my pacman project, in which the following commands are executed 
When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman will appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created will start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it will change position to stay within the frame of the web page.
