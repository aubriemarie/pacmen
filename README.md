## PAC MEN PROJECT
# pacmen

This is my pacman project, in which the following commands are executed:

When you click the “Add PacMan” button, a new pacman will appear at a random position on the screen.
When you click the “Start Game” button, the pacman or pacmen created will start moving at random velocity on the screen.
When a given pacman hits the edge of the screen, it will change position to stay within the frame of the web page.

<h2>How To Run</h2>
Download or clone the repository
Go to content folder and add it to your code editor tool
Open index.html

<h2>Future Improvements</h2>

Pacmen change face direction when hit x axis limit
